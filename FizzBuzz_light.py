# ðŸ§  Challenge: FizzBuzz Lite
# Task:
# Write a function that takes a number n and prints all numbers from 1 to n. But:
    # If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead.
    # If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead.
    # If the number is divisible by both, print "FizzBuzz".
    # Otherwise, just print the number itself.


n = 30

        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print("buzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
