# 🧠 Offline Coding Challenge Series (Python)

Welcome to my **Offline Coding Challenge Series** — a personal repository where I solve Python programming challenges from scratch, without using AI-generated code, internet tutorials, or external resources.

---

## 🎯 What This Series Is

This project is a curated, self-driven journey to strengthen my core programming skills by working through challenges of increasing difficulty. Each challenge is:

- Provided as a **text-only prompt** by ChatGPT
- Solved by me, **offline**, using only the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- Written, debugged, and tested without external code or search engine help

This repo serves as a record of how I approach problems, make mistakes, and learn through doing — not copying.

## 🤖 Challenge Source

All coding challenge **ideas and prompts** are generated by **ChatGPT** (without code). I use it to:

- Get a new challenge at a chosen difficulty level
- Receive hints or documentation links if I’m stuck
- Reflect on and review my solution once I’m done

But all code in this repo is **written entirely by me**.

✅ Challenge Rules
No use of AI-generated code, search engines, or tutorials

Only the Python docs are allowed

All logic and debugging is done manually

I document my thought process and lessons learned

🧠 Why I'm Doing This
This series is part of my effort to:

Deepen my programming foundations

Prepare for coding interviews and technical roles

Build confidence in solving problems without depending on AI or tutorials

“Practice isn’t the thing you do once you’re good. It’s the thing you do that makes you good.”

Thanks for checking out the project! Stay tuned for more challenges as I level up 💻🔥****
