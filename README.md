# ðŸ§  Offline Coding Challenge Series (Python)

Welcome to my **Offline Coding Challenge Series** â€” a personal repository where I solve Python programming challenges from scratch, without using AI-generated code, internet tutorials, or external resources.

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Series Is

This project is a curated, self-driven journey to strengthen my core programming skills by working through challenges of increasing difficulty. Each challenge is:

- Provided as a **text-only prompt** by ChatGPT
- Solved by me, **offline**, using only the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- Written, debugged, and tested without external code or search engine help

This repo serves as a record of how I approach problems, make mistakes, and learn through doing â€” not copying.

## ðŸ¤– Challenge Source

All coding challenge **ideas and prompts** are generated by **ChatGPT** (without code). I use it to:

- Get a new challenge at a chosen difficulty level
- Receive hints or documentation links if Iâ€™m stuck
- Reflect on and review my solution once Iâ€™m done

But all code in this repo is **written entirely by me**.
